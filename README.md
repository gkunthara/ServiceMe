# ServiceMe!

ServiceMe! is an iOS application which helps Gonzaga students find service opportunities around the Spokane area. Users create an account and are asked a series of "yes" or "no" questions regarding their interests. Then, the app will generate a list of service opportunities based off the user's answers.
